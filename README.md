Project Goals:
* Work on TDD
* To practice making commits for every small change
* Get better at writing commit messages

What I've Learned So Far:
* You can run tests without running your program to see if it works
   * There could still be part of your program not working, but still cool
* Writing more info for commits helps keep track of what changes were made
   * I liked having a line beneath my commit title and then every change on a new line after that
   * Making commit titles too long is overwhelming when looking back on changes
* It's a good idea to go back and check naming when an error shows up
* I like TDD, it is really nice to be able to make one small change and know exactly what I want my program to do
* Set up everything - test suite, test coverage etc. before adding code
* Builds will fail if you push multiple times, each one second after the other
* ArgumentErrors, and how to set them up with rescues
